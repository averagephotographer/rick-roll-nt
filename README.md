# Never Get RickRolled again

## TODO
1. retrieve static images from screen
2. check images for Rick Astley's face (hopefully super fast)
3. send command to stop showing his face



My plan is to stream my desktop to a face detection AI trained to recognize Rick Astley's face and then reboot the computer before the user has time to actually see his face
